#Interesting Coding Problems 

I have the habit of solving at least one-two coding problems everyday, but since I never keep track of them, eventually, I forgot all the computational methods, approaches and techniques that I have used to deal with those problems. Thus, from now on, I am going to keep track of everything on GitHub; the prompt, the solution and the analysis (hopefully). Coding problems can be from any platform; be it LeetCode, HackerRank, Project Euler, et cetera. 

Most of my code would be written in either Python or C++, but I would definitely used plain English to try to explain my approach.
